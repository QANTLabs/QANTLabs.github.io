title: QuantumCanvas - Interactive Quantum Education Platform
---

**Brief Explanation**
QuantumCanvas is an interactive educational platform that teaches quantum computing through intuition-first, hands-on learning. Unlike traditional quantum education that relies heavily on mathematics, QuantumCanvas uses visual simulations and interactive experiments to build understanding.

**The platform features:**
- **Interactive Quantum Foundations:** Visual exploration of qubits, superposition, measurement, and interference through manipulable simulations
- **Progressive Learning Paths:** Structured curriculum starting from basic concepts to advanced topics like Quantum Machine Learning
- **Experiment Builder:** Hands-on workspace where learners manipulate quantum states and observe outcomes in real-time
- **Export Capabilities:** Convert interactive experiments to OpenQASM for use with real quantum frameworks.

The UI follows Google Codelabs design patterns with clean, step-by-step tutorials and embedded interactive components.


**Expected Results**
- **Learning Module System:** Branching curriculum with foundational quantum concepts and specialized tracks (QML as first branch)
- **Interactive Simulation Components:** Bloch sphere visualizer, state vector displays, probability distribution charts, and gate effect animations
- **Experiment Workspace:** Drag-and-drop interface for building simple quantum experiments with live feedback
- **OpenQASM Export:** Convert user experiments to standard quantum circuit representations
- **Progress Tracking:** Track learner progress through modules and experiments


**Knowledge Prerequisites**
- **Frontend Development:** ReactJS, state management (Redux/Zustand), component libraries
- **Quantum Computing Basics:** Understanding of qubits, gates, and measurement (will deepen during project)
- **Visualization:** D3.js or Three.js for interactive quantum state visualizations
- **Web APIs:** REST API design for progress tracking and content delivery
